To-Do API is a RESTful API that allows users to manage their own to-dos securely. 
It features JWT authentication, CRUD operations, user-based access control, and pagination. 
Each user can only access and modify their own to-dos. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, the API ensures secure data handling. 
Authentication is handled via Bearer Tokens, and pagination improves data retrieval efficiency. ðŸš€
